# Modeling Toll Pricing for Congestion Management

## Objective

The goal of the congestion model is to determine optimal congestion tolls for each entry point into the Manhattan Central Business District that are dynamically adjusted, both:
    - Locally: at the specific entry point, and
    - Globally: across the entire Central Residential Zone (CRZ)

The model is designed to set the lowest tolls possible while maintaining congestion below a defined threshold (e.g., 0.3). This ensures traffic flow and accessibility without unnecessarily overpricing entry.
