## Modeling Toll Pricing for Congestion Management

**Objective**

The goal of the congestion model is to determine optimal congestion tolls for each entry point into the Manhattan Central Business District that are dynamically adjusted, both:
- Locally: at the specific entry point, and
- Globally: across the entire Central Residential Zone (CRZ)

The model is designed to set the lowest tolls possible while maintaining congestion below a defined threshold (e.g., 0.3). This ensures traffic flow and accessibility without unnecessarily overpricing entry.

**What Is the Congestion Score?**

Congestion score is defined as follows:
```math
\text{congestion} = 1 - \frac{\text{currentFlowRate}}{\text{freeFlowRate}}
```
where the current flow rate and free flow rate (of traffic) are pulled from a real-time traffic API (TomTom). Therefore
- 0.0 = completely free-flowing traffic
- 1.0 = total gridlock
Global congestion is measured as the average of sampled CRZ locations. Local congestion is computed per-entry-point. 

**Modeling Approach**

We used differentiable supervised learning model trained on simulated data that mimics driver responses to toll levels.

Key Components
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A feedforward neural network that takes inputs (local_congestion, global_congestion) and outputs a predicted toll.
- Differentiable Congestion Model: A fixed simulation function that predicts congestion given tolls, designed to allow gradients to flow back through toll decisions.
- Custom Loss Function:
```math
\text{Loss} = \text{Mean(Tolls)} + \lambda \cdot \max(0, \text{congestion} - \text{threshold})^2
```

We tuned:
- Î» = 1e6 (penalty weight)
- threshold = 0.3
- Learning rate, architecture (2-layer MLP with Tanh), and toll output bounds ([2.25, 18]).

This incentivizes setting the lowest possible tolls while avoiding excess congestion.
